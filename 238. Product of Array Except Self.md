# 238. Product of Array Except for Self

üîó Problem Link: [LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/)

## Approach 1: Brute force Approach üßê

### Intuition ü§î
We need to find the product of all the elements of the array except the element at the current index. 

### Approach üõ†Ô∏è
The brute force approach will be to run a `for` loop which traverses each element of the array and a nested `for` loop which then traverses to the array again, leaving the current element but multiplying the other array values of the array elements along the traversal.

### Time Complexity ‚è≥
The time complexity of this solution is **O(N^2)** because we have used a nested loop.

### Space Complexity üöÄ
Since the description states that the extra space for the output array will not be considered, so except for the `ans` vector which would have taken O(N) space (but neglected), the other variables take constant space.
So, space complexity is **O(1)**

## Approach 2: Divison
Now, the problem clearly asks us not to use division, but if you ever encounter this problem without this constraint, let us see how we solve it using division.

### Approach üõ†Ô∏è
- Calculate the product of all elements in the `nums` array to get the total product.
- Then, iterate through the array again, and for each element, calculate the result by dividing the total product by the current element's value, while also handling division by zero.

### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- The first loop for calculating the product of all elements runs in linear time, i.e., O(N).
- The second loop for filling the `ans` vector also runs in linear time, i.e., O(N).
- So, the overall time complexity is O(N).

### Space Complexity üöÄ
- The `ans` vector is used to store the result, and its space complexity is O(N) as it can grow with the input size. But the problem states that this space can be neglected.
- The `prod`, `n`, and `i` variables are constant space.
- So, the overall space complexity is O(1).

**Note:** This fails if any one of the elements is 0.
Therefore, two constraints that this approach violates are:
1. Do not use division.
2. `nums[i]` can be zero.

## Approach 3: Left-Right Product Arrays

### Approach üõ†Ô∏è
We will maintain two arrays `leftProd` and `rightProd`. At any index `i` these arrays store the product of all the left elements of that index and the product of all right elements at that index.
Now that we know the left and right element products for all indexes in the `nums` array, we multiply the left and right products at each index to find the desired output.


### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- There are two for loops with complexity O(N) each so overall time-complexity is O(2N) which is equal to about O(N).

### Space Complexity üöÄ
- The `ans` vector is used to store the result, and its space complexity is O(N) as it can grow with the input size. However, the problem states that this space can be neglected.
- The `leftprod` and `rightprod` both take up O(N) space each.
(which violates the given constraint so not the perfect solution)

## Approach 4: (Optimized Solution) Finding Prefix product and suffix product 'in place'

### Approach üõ†Ô∏è
The logic is, we don't actually need separate arrays to store prefix products and suffix products, we can do the approach discussed in method 3 directly onto our final `ans` array.

### Time Complexity ‚è≥
- There are two for loops with complexity O(N) each so overall time-complexity is O(2N) which is equal to about O(N).

### Space Complexity üöÄ
- The `ans` vector is used to store the result, and its space complexity is O(N) as it can grow with the input size. However, the problem states that this space can be neglected.
- Thus, overall space complexity is O(1).
