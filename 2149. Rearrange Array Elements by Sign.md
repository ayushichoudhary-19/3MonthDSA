# Problem: 2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign

## Approach 1: Brute Force 🧐

### Intuition 🤔
We want to rearrange an array of integers, `nums`, by placing positive integers at even indices and negative integers at odd indices while keeping the relative order of elements unchanged.

### Approach 🛠️
We'll iterate through the `nums` array and for each element, we'll check its value and the parity of the target index (even or odd). 
Then, we'll place the element at the appropriate index. If that index is already occupied, we'll look for the next available index.

### Time Complexity ⏳
Since we use nested loops, where the outer loop runs `nums.size()` times and the inner loop also runs `nums.size()` times, the time complexity is O(N^2), where N is the size of the `nums` array.

### Space Complexity 🚀
We create a new vector, `ans`, to store the rearranged array, which has the same size as `nums`. Therefore, the space complexity is O(N), where N is the size of the `nums` array.



Therefore, we get a **TLE** 🥲
